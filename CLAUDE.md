# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a personal AI assistant inspired by Tony Stark's JARVIS from Iron Man. The system initializes on startup, greets the user, accepts natural language commands, and provides daily updates and task management.

## Core Functionality

The application follows this flow:
1. User starts the app
2. JARVIS initializes and provides a greeting
3. User interacts via conversation to give commands and receive updates
4. JARVIS provides briefings on daily events (news, weather, calendar, etc.)

## Planned Features

- Intelligent greeting system on initialization
- Natural language conversation interface
- Daily briefing system (news, weather, calendar events)
- Task execution and automation
- Real-time awareness and updates

## Development Status

This is a new project in early development. Architecture and implementation details will be added as the codebase grows.

# JARVIS - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

> *"Good morning, sir. Welcome back."*

A personal AI assistant inspired by Tony Stark's JARVIS from Iron Man. Your intelligent companion for daily tasks, updates, and conversational interaction.

## Overview

JARVIS is an AI-powered assistant that greets you when you start your day, responds to voice or text commands, and keeps you informed about what's happening around you. Built to be your personal AI companion, just like Tony Stark's trusted system.

## Features

- **Intelligent Greeting**: JARVIS initializes and greets you when you start the app
- **Natural Conversation**: Talk to JARVIS using natural language commands
- **Daily Updates**: Get briefings on news, weather, calendar events, and more
- **Task Management**: Execute commands and automate tasks
- **Real-time Awareness**: Stay informed about what's happening throughout your day

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

(To be added based on implementation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tony-stark-dream.git
cd tony-stark-dream

# Install dependencies
# (Installation commands will be added)
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start JARVIS
# (Start command will be added)
```

JARVIS will initialize and greet you. From there, you can:
- Ask questions
- Request daily briefings
- Give commands
- Have natural conversations

## Example Interactions

```
JARVIS: Good morning, sir. Systems initialized and ready.

You: What's on my schedule today?

JARVIS: You have 3 meetings scheduled today. Your first meeting
        is at 9:00 AM with the engineering team.

You: What's the weather like?

JARVIS: Current temperature is 72°F with clear skies.
        Perfect conditions, sir.
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is a passion project to build a real-world JARVIS system.

## Inspiration

*"Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk."* - Tony Stark

This project is inspired by the JARVIS AI system from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While we may not have an arc reactor, we can still build an intelligent assistant that makes life a little more like being Tony Stark.
